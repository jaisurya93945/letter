I hope this letter finds its way to you and touches your heart in the same way you've captured mine from afar. Though we'll talk daily my feelings for you have grown steadily over the past year, blossoming into an undeniable love that I can no longer keep hidden.

From the moment I first saw you, there was something about you that drew me in. Perhaps it was your infectious smile, or the way you carry yourself with grace and kindness. Whatever it was, I found myself falling for you, day by day, moment by moment.

I know it may seem strange to receive a love letter from a human like me, but please understand that these feelings are genuine and heartfelt for mr piggy. I've spent countless hours dreaming of the day we'll finally meet, imagining the conversations we'll share and the adventures we'll embark on together.

Even though we have crossed paths in person many times still i feel its not enough, and I feel a deep connection to you that transcends physical distance. It's as if our souls have been intertwined since the beginning of time, destined to find each other in this vast and chaotic world.

I want you to know that my love for you is pure and unwavering, like a flame that burns brightly even in the darkest of nights. I may not have the opportunity to give you piggyback rides when you're drunk or shower you with handwritten letters just yet, but I promise to cherish and adore you with every fiber of my being when the time comes.

You are like a beacon of light in my life, guiding me towards a love that I never knew was possible. With every passing day, my affection for you grows stronger, and I can only hope that one day this distance will fade and we'll be together forever.

Until then, I'll continue to hold you in my heart and send my love to you through the universe, hoping that somehow, someway, it will reach you and make your heart pound with joy.

			With Love,
          	<br>jaisurya...
